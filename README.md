## How it works

* Six overlapping Proximity Contacts feed their outputs into a parent constraint to center a GameObject on the target.
  * The GameObject contains the Proximity Contacts, making them center themselves on the target constantly.
* The ``Allow Others`` setting on the Contacts is turned off after the Contact Tracker has attached.
  * This prevents the Contact Tracker from tracking multiple Contacts.

## Install guide

https://github.com/VRLabs/Contact-Tracker/assets/76777936/39dd0fb1-9333-42d3-91b4-8c812a24792a

* Merge the Animator Controller ``Contact Tracker FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & drop the ``Contact Tracker`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Expand the prefab hierarchy and find ``Tracker Target``.
* Move ``Tracker Target`` outside of ``Contact Tracker`` and place it anywhere in your avatar's hierarchy as needed.

## How to use

* Place the objects you want to attach to other players inside ``Contact Tracker`` -> ``Container``.
  * Alternatively you can constrain the objects to ``Contact Tracker`` -> ``Tracking Points``.
* Enable the ``ContactTracker/Control`` parameter to activate the system.
* You can edit the ``Collision Tags`` of the six Proximity Contacts to change which Contact Senders the Contact Tracker should track.
* The ``ContactTracker/Size`` parameter in the FX Controller can be changed to set the size of the Contact Tracker when it is not tracking.

## Additional notes

* The Blend Tree used in the ``Contact Tracker Blend Tree`` FX Layer **MUST** use Write Defaults **ON**!
* This is the only case in which mixing Write Defaults is okay, you do not need to switch your workflow.
